# MEAN Blog Example

A MEAN stack implementation of an example blog. 

## Objective

A learning exercise to gain a better understanding of how AnglarJS fits into a
Node.js/Express web server. 

## Original source

This example is based of the excellent tutorial by Brian Ford, [Writing an 
AngularJS App with an Express + Node.js Backend]
(http://briantford.com/blog/angular-express.html).

## Modifications

The original version used an in memory database and had no styling or tests.
This example blog builds on the tutorial by extending it to include persistent
data with MongoDB via mongoose, unit tests with Mocha/Should/sinon and add some
styling with bootstrap.
